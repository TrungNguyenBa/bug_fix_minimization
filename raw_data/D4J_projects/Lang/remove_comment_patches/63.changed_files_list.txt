0695c3f7 : Adding a unit test for #LANG-281 and a fix. The fix involves removing the reduceAndCorrect method. It appears that this method was doing sod all - which is worrying as it used to be important. I'm guessing that it was a bad fix for a bug that was then subsequently fixed with other code. I'll create a JIRA issue to create more tests to test out the +31 block of code.
