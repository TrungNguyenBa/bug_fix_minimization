< Modified semantics: "equals" methods now consider that NaNs are not
< equal (compliant with IEEE754).
< Also, two adjacent floating point numbers are considered equal (this
< is consistent with the fact that all real numbers between them can be
< represented by either of the two). One consequence of that is that
< "equals" is not transitive.
